## About
This will be a collection of responses and python based macros to control aspects of obs streaming.   Vocal input will trigger key macros and predefined and 'random' behaviours based on a tempermental model that accumulates data over the course of the session (aka the show, podcast, etc.)

Simple emotion variables will determine a potential for a certain response based on the intent and the emotion matrix. However, Montgomery will always do his job and send the key macros to (for instance) OBS-STUDIO to drive transition changes, or whatever the user has customized Montgomery's actions to entail by way of keyboard macros. I currently have not the slightest clue in python what libraries are required.  I'm beginning from the bottom here. But one thing is for sure. The more work that Monty does the more pissed off he'll get and the more likely he will be savagely insulting. Ideas include Montgomery accidentally tripping a video feed or cutting someone's volume to be a dick, and then apologize.  I could go on for decades on the ideas.  

THe following are just examples of the simple dialog responses to basic intents. 

## Examples
* "Looks like i don't have very many viewers"
      *RESPONSE: Awe. look at me. i'm a little cupcake left out in the sun too long and melting like a f**ing precious snowflake.
* "And that pisses me off"
      *RESPONSE: Stop being such a pussy.
* "I feel horrible"
      *RESPONSE: Oh here we go.
* "It's pretty cold out tonight"
      *RESPONSE: Really?  go on. . . nevermind, I don't care. have I ever told you about the time I was in the Siberian mountains? yes, hiking and frolicking in three meters of hard packed snow with winds that would burn the hide off of a Bison. it was absolutely crazy..  Anyway. What were you saying?

## Extra Bits to Consider 
* Montgomery is well travelled and has an addiction complex loving watching Fly Fishing
* will tell many stories
* will argue
* will bud into a conversation
* Can be signalled to trigger macros that can be used for podcast and livestream software like OBS-studio and such.
* Montgomery will kick your ass.
