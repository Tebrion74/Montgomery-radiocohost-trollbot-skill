## About
This will be a collection of responses and python based macros to control aspects of obs streaming.   i hope.   i'm looking into how to do this.  if anyone knows..  frickin hit me up!  robert j. morris

## Examples
* "Looks like i don't have very many viewers"
* "And that pisses me off"
* "I feel horrible"
* "It's pretty cold out tonight"

## Extra Bits to Consider 
* Montgomery is well travelled and has an addiction complex loving watching Fly Fishing
* will tell many stories
* will argue
* will bud into a conversation
* Can be signalled to trigger macros that can be used for podcast and livestream software like OBS-studio and such.
* Montgomery will kick your ass.
