## About
This will be a collection of responses and python based macros to control aspects of obs streaming.   i hope.   i'm looking into how to do this.  if anyone knows..  frickin hit me up!  robert j. morris

## Examples
* "Looks like i don't have very many viewers"
      *RESPONSE: Awe. look at me. i'm a little cupcake left out in the sun too long and melting like a f**ing precious snowflake.
* "And that pisses me off"
      *RESPONSE: Stop being such a pussy.
* "I feel horrible"
      *RESPONSE: Oh here we go.
* "It's pretty cold out tonight"
      *RESPONSE: Really?  go on. . . nevermind, I don't care. have I ever told you about the time I was in the Siberian mountains? yes, hiking and frolicking in three meters of hard packed snow with winds that would burn the hide off of a Bison. it was absolutely crazy..  Anyway. What were you saying?

## Extra Bits to Consider 
* Montgomery is well travelled and has an addiction complex loving watching Fly Fishing
* will tell many stories
* will argue
* will bud into a conversation
* Can be signalled to trigger macros that can be used for podcast and livestream software like OBS-studio and such.
* Montgomery will kick your ass.
